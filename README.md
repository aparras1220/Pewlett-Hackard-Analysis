# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview of the analysis: 
###Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to go through the employee data to be able to determine the expected number of employees that plan to retire. The company needs to be able to accurately plan the reitrement of employees to ensure that there are qualified canidates to take their place as most would assume to be in a management type setting.

##Results: 
###Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
  - By pulling the titles of everyone retiring, we know which roles will need to filled as well as how many employees in that role are reaching retirement age.

  - With the mentorship data, we can start choosing employees that will be reach to take over for their retiring coworkers

  - We can also use this data to cross reference departments to be able confirm which department is going to see the biggest impact. 
  - We can use retirement titles to see the growth of employees to determine where we can select the mentee. 


##Summary: 
###Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

  - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? By querying a count the data using the unique names we can see approx 90398 employees will have hit retiring age. 
  - Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? No, as mentorship eligibilty is only at 1,940 employees. That leaves quite a gap between those retiring and those who may be able to take their place.
